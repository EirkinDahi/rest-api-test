### What is a REST API?

A REST API is an API that follows a RESTful architectural style. The term REST stands for representaional state transfer.

The contraints that an API must conform to be considered REST include:
    - A client-server relationship, where requests are managed through HTTP
    - Stateless communication meaning no client information is stored with requests and requests are seperate and unconnected
    - Having cacheable data
    - A uniform interface for all components for ease of communication
